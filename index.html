            <h2><strong>Hello! Welcome to Handibotting ...</strong></h2>
            <p>If you haven't already done it, please take a look at the Handibot <strong>Safety Section</strong> from the <strong>Handibot Manual</strong>. [You should have received a hard copy with your tool. If not, there is a PDF version on the web at docs.handibot.com; but since you are probably connected to your tool in AP Mode at the moment, you'll need to get back on the Internet in order to view a copy.]</p>
            <p><strong>Let's get started with your Handibot.</strong> Click through the action-list below to set-up your tool and carve a test file. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with using your Handibot. Read along then click the <strong>green labels</strong> as you encountere them to put your tool in action. Later you can take up the more challenging work of designing and creating your own projects and, running and managing your Handibot more directly.</p>

              <span class='btn btn-primary'> Hey first things first ... let's remove the packing.</span>
              <p>Let's let the tool do some of the work. We'll move the Z axis -- it's the up-down, vertical axis that moves the router -- to a higher position to allow you to remove the protective foam-cylinder from around the cutter. So, close the lid, then click the next green label ...</p>
              <p><strong>Oh ... BTW, you'll be asked for permission</strong> whenever the Handibot is about to move! Push and Hold (1 sec) the plastic <strong>Green Button</strong> on the top of the tool. </p>
              <p><strong> ... and yes, the tool will bang into the top </strong> limit because we want to make sure it is all the way up. (It won't do any damage, but if it gets annoying, you can hit the <strong>STOP Button</strong> at the bottom of the screen.)</p>

                <p>And yes, you'll need to use the green button again to get things started. Note that you can always use this "Set XYZ Home" function when needed to make sure the coordinates are all calibrated as they should be. This same function is included in the FireUp! App that will be useful to you for daily set-up tasks.</p>

                <p>Normally, you will use the keypad in the right hand panel to move your tool around. Feel free to try these out by clicking on them -- the button in the middle enables the arrow keys on a PC. You can use the labels below to toggle the right panel in and out (or use the little "hamburger"icon at the top right):</p>
                <button id="call-DRO-rollout" class="btn btn-success btn-lg">click here if the KEYPAD is not visble</button>

              <hr width = "90%" noshade>
              <span class='btn btn-primary'> Now, let's try running a file ... </span>
                <p>Your Handibot should be all set to run a test file on the bottom half of the board that came attached to the bottom of your tool. Make sure the switch on the router is set to ON, and that the speed is set to about 3 on the dial on the router. </p>

            <h2>Detailed Info on this FireUp! App</h2>
            <p>This App contains a variety of "helper" functions and information for setting-up and using your Handibot. It's designed to help you learn about your tool and its operation. Most functions have short-cuts or more direct methods for putting them to use rather than using this App. After you become knowledgeable and comfortable in the use of your tool, you may find you don't use the App itself anymore. Feel free to delete it (you can always get it back from the Handibot website)</p>
            <h3>Setting the XYZ Home Locations</h3>
            	<p>Determining the zero location of each axis is automatically done for you by moving into the end-stops of the axis and then backing off an exact known distance to the location where Zero for the particular axis is set, defining your Home Location.</p>
            	<p>The back-off distance is determined at the factory and saved as a persistant variable. As you get more experienced, you may want to change the back-off distance in order to move your zero locations to better suit your work, for a particular project, or just to make a slight adjustment of your zero location. You can modify the back-off distance for each axis in the <code>Preferences</code> tab (above).</p>
            	<p>Using the Set Home function in this app is the same thing as clicking on <strong>Macro#3</strong> in the system macros, where the motion instructions are actually stored. It also the same as using the <strong>[C3] Command</strong> in the Sb4 App or in the OpenSBP fabrication language. You can use each, interchangeably.</p> 
        		<div class="well" id="cartesian-message">
                  <p><strong>Your Handibot's Coordinate System</strong> </p>
              		<p>Your tool moves around in a Cartesian coordinate system. The X axis (left/right) and the Y axis (front/back) are in the plane of the material. The X = 0 and Y = 0 locations are at the bottom left corner as you face the front of the tool. Moving the tool-head to the right is moving in increasing value in the X axis, moving it towards the back is moving it in increasing value the Y axis. Up/Down motion of the router is the  Z axis. Down is the negative direction. Zero in the Z is typically set at the height that the cutter tip is just touching the surface of the material (though for special purposes it can be set anywhere). To explore the coordinate system, Play with the keypad on in the red, DRO panel on the right:</p>
              <button id="call-DRO-rollout" class="btn btn-primary">click here if the KEYPAD is not visble</button>
              <button id="call-DRO-hide" class="btn btn-primary">or, Hide the KEYPAD</button>
                  <p></p>
              		<p>The "Touch-and-Go App" can be very instructive in understanding the coordinate system. It is also helpful in just moving the tool around. Click the button below to try it out:</p>
              		<h4><a class="btn btn-success" id="call-touch-and-go"> start: Touch-and-Go </a></h4>
            	</div>
            <h3>Measuring Bit Length</h3>
            	<p>Measuring Bit Length is sometimes called Z-Zeoring, because we are really determing the zero location for the tip of the cutter in the Z axis. More importantly for a Handibot, we are determining the back-off distance from the top Z-axis, stop to having the tip of the cutter exactly at the material (at Zero). Your tool uses electrical contact with a Z-zero plate to tell exactly the distance the tip of the cutter from the stop. It then adds the known distance from the Z-zero plate to the material surface in order to calculate an overall back-off distance that we call, "current_cutter_Zoffset". So it is not really a measurement of the actual length of the bit, but the determination of an offset distance that is based on the exposed length of the cutter.</p>
            	<p>You will also see the "current_cutter_Zoffset" in the <code>Preferences</code> tab (above).</p>
